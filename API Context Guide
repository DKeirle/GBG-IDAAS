<h2>The API Schema</h2>

<h3>Verification Services</h3>

These are services that can be used to verify the identity of an individual. Which services to use and when will be covered shortly.

Verify_Document

This service will take and process document images (pictures of identity documents e.g. Passports) in order to validate their appearance and content.

Verify_People

This service will take and process personal data in order to authenticate it against trusted data sources (e.g. Electoral Registers).

Liveness_Result

This service will take a video stream of an individual’s face and prompt the individual to perform some real time actions (e.g. asking the individual to frown) in order to assess whether the individual is actually there at the time of verification.

Facematch

This service will take and process a ‘selfie’ image of an individual (e.g. a portrait picture of the individual being verified) in order to match their face against a document with the individual’s face on it (e.g. a Passport).
